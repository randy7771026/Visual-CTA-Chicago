All Aboard
The current bus and train trackers for the CTA sucks
eggs!
If you cannot see, speak, walk or some
combination of those then I do not use the kind of
language one would use to describe the trackers.
So in my me first state of mind I built
A
Simple Bus Tracker
Just for me
Basic Human Needs
Maslow's
Living Wage
Work, Rest, Eat, Sleep
$64,000 per family of four
In this city
We can not all drive to work
We only need what we need
We need a GPS for the CTA that is tuned
To our individual needs and routes
By our route and needs it should alert us to
Things like broken elevators
and security issues
Where did this idea come from?
Illinois Department of Employment Security
Open Government Chicagoland
When I am on the Brown Line and see a place I
would like to work
RTA has two trainers to train the differently abled
One of those trainers almost killed me
I was 547 pounds and claustrophobic
Metra rail cars gave me panic attacks
She took me underground on the Blue Line
Can I do this virtually, please?
Sure, just make
IBM Watson / Occulus / Voice Synthesis
Unofficial CTA API / Google Street View
Twitter / Photo Composites / CTA Security
LinkedIn / Facebook / Reddit / Everyblock
All work together to tell me in GPS fashion
How to get from here to there
Door to Door
Walk / Wheelchair / Bike / Bus / “L”
How do I get there? Is “there” accessible?
Is there a position and who do I know there?
If we make this much better for those differently
abled it should be really great for the rest of us
